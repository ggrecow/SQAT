%
% 1. Description:
%       outsig is the weighted pressure in [Pa]
% 
% 2. Stand-alone example:
%   %%%%%%
%   % Example 2.1:
%   %%% Creating a sinuoid with an RMS of 60 dB SPL:
%   fs = 44100;
%   freq = 1000; % Hz
%   dur = 1; % s
%   t = 0:1/fs:dur-1/fs;
%   dBFS = 94; % full scale convention
%   target_lvl = 60; % 60 dB SPL
%   cal_factor = 10^((target_lvl-dBFS)/20);
%   A = 1*cal_factor*sqrt(2); % 1=full scale; sqrt(2)=relationship between RMS and peak value for a sinusoid
%   insig = A*sin(2*pi*freq*t); % zero phase sinusoid centred at f=1000;
%
%   %%% Obtaining its A-weighted amplitude, with a fast weighting:
%   outsig_dB = Do_SLM(insig,fs,'A','f',dBFS); % A-weighting
%   figure;
%   plot(outsig_dB); grid on;
%   xlabel('Time [samples]');
%   ylabel('Amplitude [dB(A)]');
% 
%   %%%%%%
%   % Example 2.2:
%   %%% This example assumes that the file is found on disk and that the dB 
%   % full scale convention (dBFS) is as the default:
%
%   file = 'D:\Databases\dir03-Speech\dutch\LISTman\jwz551.wav';
%   [insig, fs] = audioread(file);
%   Do_SLM(insig,fs,'Z','f'); % Z-weighting, fast response, with an automatic output figure
%

%       Tested cross-platform: No

% function outsig = il_integrator(insig,fs, weightingType)
%
% 1. Description: This function generates and applies an integration filter
%      to the input data. This code is based on an implementation taken from
%      the PsySound toolbox by Matt Flax (January 2007) and Farhan Rizwi 
%      (July 2007).
%
%      Inputs:
%         insig         - Incoming input signal, as a data vector
%         fs            - Sampling rate of the data
%         weightingType - RC time constant is 'f' fast (125 ms), 's' slow
%                       (1 s), or 'i' impulsive. The time constant for the 
%                       leaky integrator is tau. This is basically a low-pass 
%                       filter whose transfer function is:
%                      1
%        H(s) =  ---------------
%                tau s  +   1
