%             ** ScalarPA : PA (scalar value) computed using the percentile
%                           values of each metric.
%                           NOTE: if the signal's length is smaller than 2s, 
%                           this is the only output as no time-varying PA

%                for more info
%
%  NOTE: 1) Input signals should be in pascal values or calibrated .wav files
%
%        2) Fluctuation strength window has length of 2s. If the signal is 
%           less than 2s long, the FS calculation will be automatically
%           changed to stationary (i.e. uses a window with length equal to 
%           signal's size). in this case, no time-varying PA is available.
%
%        3) Be aware that, because of item 2), if the signal is more than 
%           2s long, the last 2 seconds of the input signal are LOST !!!!
%
%        4) is a best practice to compute percentile values following a 
%           time_skip (s) after the signal's beginning to avoid misleading 
%           results caused by possible transient effects caused by digital 
%           filtering
%
%        5) because of item 2), the PA(t) outputs are also 2s smaller, but 
%           the percentile values are calculed inside each function before 
%           this cut
%
%        6) Loudness and sharpness have the same time vector, but roughness, 
%           FS and tonality differ because of their window lengths.
%           Therefore, in order to have the same time vector, after each 
%           respective metric calculation, the outputs are interpolated 
%           with respect to the loudness time vector and all cutted in the 
%           end to the final time corresponding to the FS metric
