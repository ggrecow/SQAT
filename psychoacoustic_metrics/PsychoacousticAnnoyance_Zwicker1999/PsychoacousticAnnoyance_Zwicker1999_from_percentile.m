%   This function is a compatibility-wrapper that calculates Widmann's
%   psychoacoustic annoyance model from an input acoustic signal ---
%   As clarified by Lotinga, M. J. B. and A. J. Torija (2025) in
%   "Comment on "A study on calibration methods of noise annoyance data from listening tests"
%   [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 156, 1877–1886 (2024)]." Journal of the Acoustical
%   Society of America 157(5): 3282–3285, this model is the same as that commonly
%   misattributed to (page 327) Zwicker, E. and Fastl, H. Second ed,
%   Psychoacoustics, Facts and Models, 2nd ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999.
%
%   The original psychoacoustic annoyance model is according to: (page 66) Widmann, U. (1992). Ein Modell der
%   Psychoakustischen Lästigkeit von Schallen und seine Anwendung in der Praxis der Lärmbeurteilung
%   (A model of the psychoacoustic annoyance of sounds and its application in noise assessment practice)
%   [Doctoral thesis, Technische Universität München (Technical University of Munich)].
%
%   Widmann defined a 1-kHz tone with 40 dB SPL as the reference signal for
%   his PA model (see page 65 in the above mentioned reference), to which 
%   he assigned an annoyance value of 1 au (annoyance unit).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   WARNING: this function is merely a wrapper of the
%   <PsychoacousticAnnoyance_Widmann1992> function, kept to maintain
%   compatibility with SQAT v1.3 and below. Nevertheless, this function,
%   will be removed in future releases
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% - This metric combines 4 psychoacoustic metrics to quantitatively describe annoyance:
%
%    1) Loudness (sone) - calculated hereafter following ISO 532-1:2017
%       type <help Loudness_ISO532_1> for more info
%
%    2) Sharpness (acum) - calculated hereafter following DIN 45692:2009
%       NOTE: uses DIN 45692 weighting function by default, please change code if
%       the use of a different weighting function is desired. However, note
%       that the original PA model sharpness weighting is equal to the DIN
%       45692 weighting (i.e., Widmann weighting).
%       type <help Sharpness_DIN45692_from_loudness>
%
%    3) Roughness (asper) - calculated hereafter following Daniel & Weber model
%       type <help Roughness_Daniel1997> for more info
%
%    4) Fluctuation strength (vacil) - calculated hereafter following Osses et al. model
%       type <help FluctuationStrength_Osses2016> for more info
%
%   It should be noted however that the original model used metrics for
%   roughness and fluctuation strength that differ from those employed in
%   this implementation. The metrics employed in the original PA model
%   comprised Fastl's roughness and fluctuation strength (see Fastl &
%   Zwicker, 2007. Psychoacoustics: Facts and models.). Neverthless, calculation
%   of Widmann's psychoacoustic annoyance from the reference signal (i.e., 40 dBSPL tone at 1 kHz)
%   using this implementation yields a value of 1 (au).
