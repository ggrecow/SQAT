%  This function calculates the fluctuation strength using the model 
%    developed by: [1] Osses, A., Garcia A., and Kohlrausch, A.. 
%    "Modelling the sensation of fluctuation strength." Proceedings of 
%    Meetings on Acoustics 22 ICA. Vol. 28, 050005. doi:10.1121/2.0000410

%  Reference signal: 60 dBSPL 1 kHz tone 100% modulated at 4 Hz should yield 1 vacil.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% INPUT:
%   insig : [Nx1] array
%   insig is a monophonic calibrated audio signal (Pa)
%
%   fs : sampling frequency (Hz) - Defaults of 48 kHz or 44.1 kHz (pre-computed
%                                    filters.
%   method : integer
%   method=0, stationary analysis - window size=length(insig) (s) kind of 
%             an rms value
%   method=1, time_varying analysis - window size=2 (s)
%             NOTE: if the signal's length is smaller than 2s, the analysis
%             is automatically changed to method=0
%
%   time_skip : integer
%   skip start of the signal in <time_skip> seconds for statistics calculations
%
%   show : logical(boolean)
%   optional parameter for figures (results) display
%   'false' (disable, default value) or 'true' (enable).
%
%   struct_opt: struct where some specific model parameters can
%   be set to a different value. If not specified, the default values are used. 
%   Currently, the only parameter that can be changed is the a0
%   (outer and middle ear transmission factor). For that, the struct <struct_opt> needs to 
%   contain the parameter <a0_type>, meaning <struct_opt.a0_type = 'string_input'> 
%   should be defined with one of the following <string_input>:
%
%  string_input = 'fluctuationstrength_osses2016' :  A simplified a0 factor can be adopted if 
%  <a0_type> is set to this option, where the ear canal resonance of Fastl's a0 curve is removed. 
%  In other words, the a0 curve is roughly approximated as a low-pass filter. Although not 
%  explicitly stated by Osses et al. 2016 (doi: 10.1121/2.0000410), the simplified a0 transmission 
%  curve leads to very similar results during the validation of their fluctuation strength algorithm.
%  This is the default which is used if no input is given at all, as defined by the model's author
%  
%  string_input = 'fastl2007' : uses the transmission factor for free-field,
%  according to Fig 8.18 (page 226) in Fastl & Zwicker Book, Psychoacoustics: facts and
%  models 3rd edition (doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-68888-4)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   OUT : struct containing the following fields
%
%       * InstantaneousFluctuationStrength: instantaneous fluctuation 
%           strength (vacil) vs time
%       * InstantaneousSpecificFluctuationStrength: specific fluctuation 
%           strength (vacil/Bark) vs time and Bark scale
%       * TimeAveragedSpecificFluctuationStrength: time-averaged specific 
%           fluctuation strength (vacil/Bark) vs Bark scale
%       * barkAxis : vector of Bark band numbers used for specific 
%           fluctuation strength computation
%       * time : time vector in seconds
%       * Several statistics based on the InstantaneousFS
%         ** FSmean : mean value of InstantaneousFS (vacil)
%         ** FSstd : standard deviation of InstantaneousFluctuationStrength
%              (vacil)
%         ** FSmax : maximum of InstantaneousFluctuationStrength (vacil)
%         ** FSmin : minimum of InstantaneousFluctuationStrength (vacil)
%         ** FSx : fluctuation strength value exceeded during x percent of the time (vacil)

%     1) includes resampling to 44100 Hz, which is preferible because it 
%        takes less time to compute than 48 kHz because of the filtering 
%        process of IIR filters for modeling the Hweigth parameter
%     2) include possibility to choose method (stationary or time-varying) 
%        which affects the window size
% Author: Alejandro Osses, 10/05/2023. Appropriate scaling for the specific 
%            fluctuation strength.
% Author: Alejandro Osses, 11/05/2023. Moving TerhardtExcitationPatterns_v3, 
%            Get_Bark to the private folder (old il_* functions)
% Author: Alejandro Osses, 13/11/2024. Included <struct_opt> input to allow
%            for changing the a0 transmission factor. the a0 transmission
%            factor were moved to the <utilities> folder of the toolbox as
