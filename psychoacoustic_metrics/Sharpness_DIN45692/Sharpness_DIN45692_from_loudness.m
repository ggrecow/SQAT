% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%   SpecificLoudness : array
%   if method = 0 (stationary) - Specific loudness [1,sone/Bark]
%   if method = 1 (time-varying) - Instantaneous specific loudness [nTimeSteps,sone/Bark]
%
%   weight_type : string
%       weighting function used for sharpness calculation, according to:
%       - 'DIN45692'
%       - 'bismarck'
%       - 'aures' (dependent on the specific loudness level)
%
%   time : array
%       time vector of the specific loudness [1,nTimeSteps] - used only for
%       plot purposes if method = 1 (time-varying)
%
%   time_skip : integer
%   skip start of the signal in <time_skip> seconds for statistics 
%       calculations (method=1 (time-varying) only)
%
%   show : logical(boolean)
%   optional parameter for figures (results) display (only method=1)
%   'false' (disable, default value) or 'true' (enable).
%
% OUTPUTS (method==0; stationary)
%   OUT : struct containing the following fields
%
%       * Sharpness: sharpness (acum)
%
% OUTPUTS (method==1; time-varying)
%   OUT : struct containing the following fields
%
%       * InstantaneousSharpness: instantaneous sharpness (acum) vs time
%       * time : time vector in seconds
%       * Several statistics based on the InstantaneousSharpness (acum)
%         ** Smean : mean value of InstantaneousSharpness (acum)
%         ** Sstd : standard deviation of InstantaneousSharpness (acum)
%         ** Smax : maximum of InstantaneousSharpness (acum)
%         ** Smin : minimum of InstantaneousSharpness (acum)
%         ** Sx : sharpness value exceeded during x percent of the time (acum)
%
%           *** HINT: time-varying loudness calculation takes some time to
%                     have a steady-response (thus sharpness too!). 
%                     Therefore, it is a good practice to consider a 
%                     time_skip to compute the statistics
