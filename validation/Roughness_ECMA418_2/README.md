# Roughness model according to ECMA-418-2:2024: verification of the implementation in SQAT

In SQAT, an implementation of the roughness model according to ECMA-418-2:2024 [1] is provided. The implementation is named `Roughness_ECMA418_2` (see code [here](../../psychoacoustic_metrics/Roughness_ECMA418_2/Roughness_ECMA418_2.m)). The following verification studies are available for this implementation:

- [Roughness dependence of AM tones on the modulation frequency](1_AM_modulation_freq)
