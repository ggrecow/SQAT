# About this code 
The `validation_technical_signals_time_varying.m` code is used to verify the loudness implementation according to ISO 532-1 [1] (see `Loudness_ISO532_1`code [here](../../../psychoacoustic_metrics/Loudness_ISO532_1/Loudness_ISO532_1.m)). The verification of the time-varying loudness method is performed considering the technical test sounds provided in the Annex B.5 of the ISO standard.

# How to use this code
In order to run this code and reproduce the figures available in the `figs` folder, the user needs to download the dataset of sound files from zenodo <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933206" target="_blank">here</a>. The obtained folder called `validation_SQAT_v1_0` has to be included in the `sound_files` folder of the toolbox. 

# Results
The figures below compare the results obtained using the `Loudness_ISO532_1` implementation in SQAT with the tolerance reference values from the ISO standard.

A summary presenting the differences (max. total loudness and 5\% percentile loudness) between calculated (SQAT) and reference values provided by ISO 532-1 is presented below for signals 14-25. The differences are not bigger than $\pm1$ sone for any signal of metric. Despite providing reference values, the ISO standard do not stipulates any tolerance values for technical time-varying signals in terms of those single-value indicators.
