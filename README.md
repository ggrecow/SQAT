# SQAT: a sound quality analysis toolbox for MATLAB
This is the repository of **SQAT**, an open-source **S**ound **Q**uality **A**nalysis **T**oolbox for MATLAB. It contains a collection of codes implementing key metrics for **quantitative** sound quality analysis. With **SQAT** you can conduct quick quantitative sound quality analysis on any calibrated input sound file, in Pascal units. To give a transparent indication of how close the implementations are to the original models, we provide a detailed set of verification routines. Moreover, a number of example codes and exemplary sound files are provided in order to facilitate the initial use of the algorithms.  

# Toolbox structure
The toolbox has the following directories:
- `psychoacoustic_metrics`: this directory contains a number of algorithms implementing a specific psychoacoustic metric (see [folder](psychoacoustic_metrics)). 
- `sound_level_meter`: contains scripts to obtain sound pressure levels using different frequency weightings (A, B, C, D or Z) and time weightings (fast, slow, or impulse) (see [folder](sound_level_meter)). 
- `utilities`: contains some scripts that are complementary to any of the toolbox functions (see [folder](utilities)).
- `examples`: an example script is provided for each metric (see [folder](examples)).
- `sound_files`: this directory hosts reference sounds in .wav format that are used mainly by the `examples` codes (see [folder](sound_files)). 
- `validation`: this directory contains scripts used to validate each algorithm. Instructions on how to run these codes are provided in each respective folder and directly on the header of the codes (see [folder](validation)). 
- `publications`: contains scripts to reproduce figures and/or tables of publications from the toolbox authors (see [folder](publications)). 

# How to use the toolbox

1. Download or clone this repository to your local computer. One way to do that is to press the button 'Code' -> Choose 'Download ZIP' and unzip somewhere).

2. After that, you need to add the relevant folders of the toolbox to the path of your MATLAB. Open and run the `startup_SQAT.m` script to automatically perform this task. In order to avoid conflicts, the `startup_SQAT.m` needs to be used every time MATLAB is (re)started. If you just want to use the metrics, you can add manually only the relevant folders to the MATLAB path (e.g., `psychoacoustic_metrics`, `sound_level_meter`, and `utilities`).

# Toolbox history

Motivated by the limited access to well-documented and validated open-source implementations of perceptually-inspired metrics, [Gil Felix Greco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gil-felix-greco-363985101/) initiated in the end of 2019 a compilation of algorithms to be used in the evaluation of environmental aircraft noise. In 2021, this set of algorithms was compiled into a MATLAB toolbox, which was named for the first time as a sound quality analysis toolbox (SQAT), and applied to analyze the sound quality of a novel aircraft concept (see publication below). This preliminary SQAT version (not hosted in this repository) required a very specific format of input parameters provided by an aircraft noise prediction research software (PANAM/DLR), suited to the needs of the aforementioned publication.

> Felix Greco, G., Bertsch, L., Ring, T. P., & Langer, S. C. (2021). Sound quality assessment of a medium-range aircraft with enhanced fan-noise shielding design. [CEAS Aeronautical Journal](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13272-021-00515-9) 12, 481–493.

The actual conception of the SQAT toolbox as published in this repository occurred in October 2022, after inspiring discussions during the ICA conference in South Korea, where Gil met Alejandro and Roberto. [Alejandro Osses](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-osses-10039883/) has been actively contributing to the hearing research community since 2014 and as a developer of the AMT toolbox since 2020 (amtoolbox.org). He provided know-how about code structure and the use of GitHub. [Roberto Merino-Martínez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberto-merino-martinez/) has been active in the use and development of sound quality metrics and their actual validation through listening experiments, also contributing some of his code implementations to the team. As a result of Gil's previous efforts and the newly joined forces, we were able to publish the first release of the toolbox, SQAT v1.0 in May 2023. In 2025, [Mike Lotinga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-lotinga-6890328/) joined the team of maintainers after contributing to SQAT v1.3 with the implementation of ECMA-418-2 models.


Within the SQAT team, we are committed to carefully maintaining the toolbox in the long term, thus supporting its use as a reliable and readily accessible tool. The inclusion of new metrics in the future is foreseen as long as enough verification and documentation related to their implementations are (or can be made) available. With this strong requirement, we will only publish implementations that are mature enough for general use, without necessarily requiring further updates after a code is released. We are committed to ensuring backward compatibility of the codes across SQAT releases. However, small unforeseen issues will be fixed as quickly as possible. If that is the case, any changes will be clearly stated it in the documentation. For this reason, we recommend that users always inform which version of SQAT has been used, and to use the most up-to-date release of the toolbox.
