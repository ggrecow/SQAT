% roughWeight = ShmRoughWeight(modRate, modfreqMaxWeight, roughWeightParams)
%
% Returns roughness weighting for high- and low-frequency (modulation
% rates) according to ECMA-418-2:2024 (the Sottek Hearing Model) for a set
% of modulation rates and parameters.

%                    maximum value (one)
%
% roughWeightParams : the parameters for the each of the weightings (high
%                     or low)
