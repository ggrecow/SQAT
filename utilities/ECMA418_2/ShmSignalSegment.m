% Returns input signal segmented into blocks for processing.
%
% Inputs
% ------
% signal : vector or 2D matrix
%          the input signal/s
%
% axisn : integer (1 or 2, default: 1)
%         the axis along which to apply block segmentation
%
% blockSize : integer
%             the block size in samples
%
% overlap : double (>=0, < 1)
%           the proportion of overlap for each successive block
%
% i_start : integer (optional, default: 1)
%           the sample index from which to start the segmented signal
%
% endShrink : Boolean (optional, default: false)
%             option to include the end of the signal data in a block using
%             increased overlap with the preceding block
% 
% Returns
% -------
% For each channel in the input signal:
%
% signalSegmented : 2D or 3D matrix
%                   the segmented signal, arranged by channels over the
%                   last axis, samples (within each block) along the axis
%                   corresponding with axisn, and block number along the
%                   other remaining axis
%
% Also: 
%
% iBlocks : vector
%           the indices corresponding with each block starting index
